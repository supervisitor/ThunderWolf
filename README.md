the next Gen. Browser without all the useless

Today, a browser can do so much that we turn it off again with a plugin to regain our privacy.
In addition, today's browsers still do so much useless stuff in the background that it's best to use a high-performance machine for simple pages.

That can't be, a modern browser should be better: without all the useless stuff.

This browser doesn't send a list of installed fonts... this browser displays modern HTML5/CSS3 pages.
